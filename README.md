# Inflation-rate-forecasting
We will be using the data provided by the world bank and try forecasting the inflation rate for the coming years of particular countries. This will be done in R.
- Currently I am using an Inflation data set for my Business Forecasting Project. Using Inflation trends we intent to use past values for India and USA which will be helpful in forecasting future inflation. The data that we are using is based on Inflation as measured by the consumer price index reflecting the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specific intervals on yearly basis
- This is an Economic Forecast and a Point forecast.
- In order to bring out the best outcome, we will compute the accuracy of the specifications using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = (Absolute Error/Actual Volume) * 100
- In terms of time component, this is a Long Forecast. The trends are defined annually ranging from the year 1960-2020.
